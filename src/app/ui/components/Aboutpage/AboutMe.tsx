            Iâ€™m <strong>Ige-Edaba Enaikato Cathy</strong>, a frontend developer,
            product tinkerer, and the curious mind behind{" "}
            <strong>404-FOUND!</strong> â€” but my journey didnâ€™t begin in code.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg">
            I started in healthcare, drawn by a deep desire to help people, I
            discovered coding as a new form of creative problem-solving. One
            powered by logic, creativity, and pixels. Learning to code was like
            learning a new language, one where I could build things that
            mattered and share them with the world.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg">
            <strong>404-FOUND!</strong> is more than a dev blog, itâ€™s a digital
            reflection of my shift from saving lives to designing better digital
            experiences. It's a space where I share what Iâ€™m learning, building,
            and exploring.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg">
            Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking, sci-fi films, and spontaneous
            creativity. If you're navigating your own path in tech, especially
            through a career pivot. youâ€™re not alone. 
            <strong>You belong here.</strong>
